# Optimal-Change-Calculator

This project was proposed for the Algorithms & Data Structures masters course. It consisted of a solution to an optimization problem involving a money change back machine that calculates the most efficient change (using the least amount of currency possible) for given inputs of change owed and coin availability.

The problem was solved using three differenc procedures: 

- With a Greedy Algorithm;
- With a Graph;
- Using Dynamic Programming;

Finally, the three methods were compared by time complexity.
